After dueling multiple times recently, iv'e relized vampires are very powerful.<br></br>
The combos that are possable to pull off, tend to be very devastating.<br></br>
One combo I use would be cards("like call to the feast and ethereal absolution")that create tokens and power up.<br></br>
So I created a high number of vampires with life link, and make them stronger to deal more damge then gain more life in return.<br></br>
Of course that is my primary strategy, and it works very well beside my favorite card in that deck("GHOSTLY PRISON!!!!").<br></br>
An opponent I faced of recent that used vampires, utilized life link in addition to A card called, epicure of blood for incredible life gain("and drain").<br></br>
This combo effectivly drained my life clean, and added it on to his own life point total.<br></br>  
At this point you should also take into consideration, that I was using A mono black zombie deck("with a good number of zombies that have flying").<br></br>
Holy crap right?<br></br>
It was one seriously wild match, that resulted in my zombies being leeched to the point of defeat.<br></br>
It felt like the damage I dealt was kind of pointless, due to the fact that he gained the life back.<br></br>
But hey thats vampires for ya right?<br></br>
And so it occured to me that vampires, are one of the more robust creature types in the game.<br></br>
